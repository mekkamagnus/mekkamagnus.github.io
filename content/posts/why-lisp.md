-   It's easy to create a Lisp Language
-   It's Easy to Make a Lisp Language Domain Specific
-   Writing a parser and compiler for Lisp is way claner than other languages

## Lisp Helps Me with My Programmatic Thinking {#lisp-helps-me-with-my-programmatic-thinking}

-   Once you know Lisp you think of programming in a very different way.


## Lisp has heavy ties to Functional Programming {#lisp-has-heavy-ties-to-functional-programming}

-   My interested in mathematics has motivated my interest in functional programming.
-   A lot of functional programming ideas implemented in other programming languages started in Lisp.

-   Its easy to build a prototype of an idea in Lisp.
-   Many programms have started as Emacs packages.

-   The discretionary exportable functionality entrusted to the individual Lisp programmer is more than an order of magnitude greater than that to be found within Pascal enterprises. - Alan J. Perlis
-   Development of programs in Lisp proceeds somewhere between 1000 and 5000 times faster then development in "modern" or "improved" computer languages. - Douglas Lenat Lex Fridman Podcast
-   You can hire fewer people, by 80%, by developing in Lisp. - Eric Normand
-   You don't need a lot of dependencies to get your project off in Lisp
