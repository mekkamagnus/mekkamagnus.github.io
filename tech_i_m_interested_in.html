<h2 id="org27ec57f">Focus on the Fundamentals</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org27ec57f">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>In all of my learning of programming and computer science I would like to keep a focus on having strong fundamentals. This desire to have strong fundamentals is what informs my decisions on what to learn and in what order.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="orgcd8b5f4">JavaScript</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcd8b5f4">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Many sources online say you should take either JavaScript or Python as your first language.</li>
<li>I like that JavaScript has more of a closeness to C-syntax since C is a high priority on my list of languages to learn.</li>
<li>With JavaScript I can build and interact with the full stack of web development. I can work from browser to server. This means the skills I learn can be applied to more places.</li>
<li>JavaScript is thought of having a closeness to Lisp. So this also feeds in to my desire to learn Lisp.</li>
<li>In learning JavaScript I believe it will be easy to crossover into Python. But I don't think it would be as easy the other way around.  In the end, Python being a very important language, I will still get to learning it at some point no matter what.</li>
<li>It's important to really grokk one language. Then it will be easier to pick up the rest because I will actually understand the core principles of programming.
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Sort of like mastering one key in song writing. Then later it will be easy to pick up the rest of the keys.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>JavaScript works in the browser which means that I can build little applications that can run in browser. No need to download anything.</li>

<h3 id="orgebf1926">Lisp/Elisp</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgebf1926">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I learned lisp because of reading that it will help you to be a better programming. However they also say it shouldn't be your first language.</li>
<li>As a result of learning lisp I was lead towards Emacs</li>
<li>Emacs I believe also helps me to be a better programmer
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>All of the greatest engineers in the world use emacs</li>
<li>Emacs is the 100 year editor</li>
<li>You have to be way smart to use emacs well and it makes you incredibily powerful if you can master it.</li>
<li><p>
I find there is a certain power in being able to customize your tools. And once you get the hang of it customizing it is actually quite simple
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
The great programmers, on the other hand, will adapt their environment to suit themselves, in such ways as writing scripts or their own tools, or extending their tools.
</p>
</blockquote></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>


<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Emacs gives me inspiration to keep learing lisp and by extension programming fundamentals in general.</li>
<li>Emacs is a mix of C and [Emacs-]Lisp so it re enforces my skills in each of those areas.</li>
</ul>

<div id="outline-container-orgcf779d8" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="orgcf779d8">C</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgcf779d8">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>C, even more so then C++, seems to be at the core of computer programming and computer science in general.</li>
<li>With C I'm indirectly developing skills in most other languages.</li>
<li>C gives you an appreciation of how computers work.</li>

<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgf769b0e">
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>I find blockchain technology facinating.</li>
<li>I love the mix of technology, economics, and finance.</li>

<li>The tech, computer science and programming landscape is vast.</li>
